# clustering
K-means and K-medians clustering algorithms implemented on categories of words.

Categories of words are animals, fruits, countries, and vegetables. The data files can be found in this repo. 

Output of code should be several visualizations of the clustering algorithms' accuracy scores (precision, recall, F1-score) for different values of K (1-9). The functions also allow for normalization of data before processing, which impacts final accuracy.
